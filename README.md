# WebAppMVP

My current project is an MVP, or Minimum Viable Product. It's a mini web app designed for a caretaking department to improve communication and coordination between workers, supervisors, and managers. The app provides a clear view of daily operations, including event schedules, attendance tracking, task assignments, and supply requests.

For example, managers can track which workers are present or away in each building and assign tasks accordingly. Workers can submit supply requests directly through the app, and the management team can monitor supply usage across different buildings and analyze monthly consumption. Overall, the app helps streamline operations and improve efficiency within the team.
